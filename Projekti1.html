                Lately I've been hard to reach
                Everybody has a private world
                Are you calling me?
                Are you trying to get through?
                Are you reaching out for me?
                Then I'm reaching out for you

                I'm just so  depressed
                If I could just get over this hump
                But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
                I took my bruises, took my lumps
                Fell down and I got right back up
            </div>

               In my shoes, just to see
               What it's like to be me
               I'll be you, let's trade shoes
               Just to see what it'd be like to
               Feel your pain, you feel mine
               Go inside each other's minds
               Just to see what we find
               Look at shit through each other's eyes
